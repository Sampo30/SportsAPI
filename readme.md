This is my project Sports API

It is uses node.js and mongoDB/mongoose.
It has routes to get all players info, one players info with id, to create new player, to edit/update a player and to delete a player.

It is deployd with render: https://sports-api-o5gx.onrender.com/

I tested it with API development platform Insomnia and all routes worked.
